Visa, MasterCard, Neteller, Skrill, and other major payment providers are available on this casino. The banking system is pretty convenient and transactions are immediately shown up on the player’s account.    </p>    <p>        Despite these many advantages, the promotions system of BAO crypto casino is not so convenient compared to other BTC casinos. They only provide one bonus which is a welcome bonus or its alternative High Roller bonus that’s available only on the first deposit. Therefore, this casino is a good choice for newcomers but old users don’t have a chance to get weekly or monthly bonuses and cashback which are usually provided by other casinos. Also, even though the game selection is huge and supported by the world’s leading providers, you can’t search for your favorite game on the platform. But still, even though it has a few disadvantages, you can take great advantage of this Australian casino.    </p></div>",

TrueFlip bitcoin casino is among them as it belongs to Blockchain Games N.V. and operates under the digital license number 145550.    </p>    <p>        <img className='my-4 img-fluid imgLeft' src='/images/casinos/trueflip/trueflipReview2.webp' alt='trueflip ScreenShot' />        It’s considered a trusted brand by several reviewers and indeed, if you look at their responsible gambling section, you’ll see that the casino tries so hard to protect their users from online threats and frauds. For ensured safety, the online casino uses SoftSwiss – it’s a very reliable online casino platform that provides trusted fair games and protect users from scams. Besides, the casino has a KYC check. KYC (Know Your Customer) is a bank and trade regulation for financial institutions and bookmakers, as well as private online casinos.    </p>    <p>        This technique is used to increase the safety before customers start to carry out any financial transaction. KYC actually contributes a lot to avoid frauds as the system allows regulators to identify possible cases of fraud and scams easily and determine risks when working with a client. TrueFlip Curacao makes sure that this system works both for cryptos and fiat money. However, sometimes it can be disturbing because due to KYC checks, several players are instantly excluded from joining the casino simply because of their country of residence.    </p>    <p>        <img className='my-4 img-fluid imgRight' src='/images/casinos/trueflip/trueflipReview3.webp' alt='trueflip ScreenShot' />        But still, the encryption system of TrueFlip is a guarantee that players are protected and data privacy is guaranteed as nobody has access to their personal information. It’s especially important to protect players’ funds when they gamble with BTC and other cryptos, and on this website, this is ensured as well. So, customers can be certain that they can take part in fair and open odds of winning. However, if something still bothers you, you can contact the customer team or open a dispute, because regulators are always ready to help you in resolving disputes. But the disadvantage is that due to KYC checks, the verification process takes long sometimes.    </p>    <h4 className='que'>TrueFlip Casino Bitcoin Deposits/Withdrawals – Are There Other Options?</h4>    <p>        TrueFlip has certain policies for making deposits and withdrawing money in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The main advantage of the payment system is that it’s a hybrid system, meaning that you can either make transactions in cryptos or use traditional payment methods. However, there are some things you should pay attention to if you are making transactions in cryptos.    </p>    <p>        First of all, players are required to meet the minimum requirement for deposits and withdrawals. Otherwise, their transactions won’t be credited. The minimum amount of deposit for BTC is 0.0001 BTC, while the minimum withdrawal is 0.002 BTC. Below you can see minimum deposit and withdrawal requirements for other cryptocurrencies that are available on this casino. The maximum deposit amount per transaction varies depending on the payment method. While there are some limitations for fiat currencies, there is no maximum amount of deposits and withdrawals for cryptos.    </p>    <div className='d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center'>        <img className='my-4 img-fluid'  src='/images/casinos/trueflip/trueflipReview4.webp' alt='trueflip ScreenShot' />    </div>    <p>        According to TrueFlip reviews, sometimes users have to pay some fees for certain withdrawal methods or countries. While playing online casinos, a player is always fully responsible for paying all fees and taxes applied to their winnings according to the laws of the jurisdiction of their residence. However, True Flip charges no fee for withdrawals of any of these cryptocurrencies with exception of TFL. In the case of TFL withdrawal, True Flip charges 1 TFL due to blockchain fees and transaction fees inside the platform. That’s because the TrueFlip token is an internal operating currency on the website and requires some taxes for blockchain. Other than this, every crypto is without any additional fees.    </p>    <p>        Keep in mind that deposited funds are available on your digital account within a reasonable amount of time following the confirmation of the deposit made. And it’s important to meet all the requirements in order to claim TrueFlip no deposit bonus or other bonuses after participating in various games on this website.    </p>    <table className='reviewTable'>        <tr className='reviewHeader'>            <th className='reviewCol'>Crypto</th>            <th className='reviewCol'>Fee</th>            <th className='reviewCol'>Min Deposit</th>            <th className='reviewCol'>Max Deposit</th>            <th className='reviewCol'>Min Withdrawal</th>            <th className='reviewCol'>Max Withdrawal</th>        </tr>        <tr className=''>            <td className='reviewCol'>Bitcoin</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0%</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.0001 BTC</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.002 BTC</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>        </tr>        <tr className=''>            <td className='reviewCol'>Ethereum</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0%</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 ETH</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 ETH</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>        </tr>        <tr className=''>            <td className='reviewCol'>Litecoin</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0%</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 LTC</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 LTC</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>        </tr>        <tr className=''>            <td className='reviewCol'>Dogecoin</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0%</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 DOGE</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 DOGE</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>        </tr>        <tr className=''>            <td className='reviewCol'>Bitcoin Cash</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0%</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.003 BCH</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.003 BCH</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>        </tr>        <tr className=''>            <td className='reviewCol'>True Flip Token</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0%</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 TFL</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 TFL</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>        </tr>        <tr className=''>            <td className='reviewCol'>Tether</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0%</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.0001 USDT</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.0001 USDT</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>        </tr>        <tr className=''>            <td className='reviewCol'>Cardano</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0%</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 ADA</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 ADA</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>        </tr>        <tr className=''>            <td className='reviewCol'>Ripple</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0%</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 XRP</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0.01 XRP</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>        </tr>        <tr className=''>            <td className='reviewCol'>Neo</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>0%</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>1 NEO</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>1 NEO</td>            <td className='reviewCol'>N/A</td>        </tr>    </table>    <h5 className='que'>Other Deposit Options</h5>    <p>        Considering the fact that not every casino user feels comfortable with cryptocurrencies, most of the casinos refuse to operate only in BTC or other currencies. Although TrueFlip is famous as a crypto-casino, in this case as well, it provides plenty of traditional payment methods and fiat currencies. On this online casino, you can deposit and withdraw with a vast range of payment methods, such as classic Master Card and Visa cards, digital wallets, top cryptocurrencies, and other alternative payment solutions, but note that these payment methods can be region-specific and isn’t applicable for every user according to where they live.    </p>    <p>        Making transactions in cryptos is indeed much more favorable on this website because, unlike cryptos, there are requirements for both minimum and maximum amount of deposits and withdrawals in fiat. Specifically, with the rules of TrueFlip crypto casino, the minimal amount for withdrawal in fiat is 10 EUR or equivalent in other currencies. The maximum amount for withdrawal depends on the payment method a player decides to use. Also, there are no additional fees, but they may apply for certain withdrawal methods or countries, which will be indicated on the withdrawal page.    </p>    <table className='reviewTable'>
