It carries a license from a Casbit Group N.V. company that works under the laws of Curacao. This is a huge factor when it comes to safety and reliability since any regulator residing in Curacao has a highly reputable name and if any gambling platform is regulated by them, it means that you are protected from any kind of fraud and manipulation.    </p>    <p>        Moreover, due to the fact that JustBit crypto casino is partnered with the industry’s leading software development companies, you are guaranteed that every game is 100% safe and fair here.

It is a well-known fact that cryptos utilize blockchain technology in order to protect every transaction maximally, so you will be able to deposit and withdraw funds here without worrying about anything. What’s more, every payment takes place within a few minutes when it comes to cryptocurrencies, so you no longer need to wait for a while for this process.

These are some of the most popular cryptos in the world, so it comes as no surprise that JustBit has decided to implement them in their games. The process of crypto gambling is very simple as it requires only a few steps which we will cover below, and keep in mind that you will experience the highest security and instant transactions when it comes to cryptocurrencies.    </p>    <p>        As for the fiat currencies, you have the possibility to use EUR, USD, PLN, SGD, CZK, KRW, JPY, and NZD in this casino. However, being a newly established website, the developers are still working to fully enable this process for customers, so right now you might experience a few problems when depositing and withdrawing money with fiat currencies. But, they will fix everything in the near future and this process will be as simple as with cryptos! As you can tell, JustBit casino includes diverse opportunities when it comes to deposits and withdrawals in order to satisfy every user. So, feel free to choose whichever option is right for you and start gambling as soon as possible!    </p>    <h4 className='que'>JustBit Bitcoin Deposits/Withdrawals – What Are The Options?</h4>    <p>        In this section, we are going to talk about the minimum and maximum limits of deposits and withdrawals in the JustBit crypto casino. Obviously, the exact numbers depend on the payment method you choose, so you have to read about the limits before option for certain options. When it comes to the payments made by Visa and Mastercard the limit per transaction is 5,000 EUR, per day is 10,000 EUR, and per month is 15,000 EUR. So, this is a perfect opportunity for punters who love to gamble with huge stakes!    </p>    <p>        There is a limit when you deposit funds with cryptocurrencies since you need to provide at least 0.0005 BTC in order to start gambling here.
