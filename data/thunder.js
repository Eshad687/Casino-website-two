        The casino oriented on eSports and sports betting, offering a unique VIP club and different cryptos for payment is one of many things we are going to talk about in this ThunderPick review. The young bookmaker Thunderpick’S activity in the gambling market began in 2017. Thunder Payments Limited, which owns Thunderpick, is registered in Malta. The work is carried out online on the basis of the Curacao license No. 365/JA.

        The bookmaker’s website is available in 6 languages. The account can be opened in dollars, euros. At the same time, the bookmaker offers to bet in 6 different cryptocurrencies.
    </p>
    <p>

However, the wide scope of different sporting events are present in this direction. Otherwise, just over 10 sports are represented.
    </p>
    <p>
        Odds at the bookmaker are average – the one you will see at a regular sportsbook.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the features of the work of Thunderpick, we can note that there is a loyalty program, according to which players of ThunderPick crypto bookmaker at the end of the month receive points and can exchange them for valuable prizes. The bookmaker also offers new players a welcome bonus.

    <h4 className='que'>Is ThunderPick Safe?</h4>
    <p>
        As has been mentioned above the company which owns ThunderPick is registered in Malta. The latter is considered one of the most reliable countries for conducting a gambling business. At the same time, ThunderPick has a license from Curacao. So we can deduce that the casino is completely reliable and safe for gambling.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may wonder why regulation carries such a big importance for a Bitcoin casino and in this case ThunderPick Bitcoin bookmaker. First of all, we are talking about bookmaker, which offers odds for different sports. Fair and open odds of winning are essential for any player. If there is an unfair advantage from a casino, it only affects badly its reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
        We should also note that a license is perfect for resolving legal issues with casinos. No one is 100% safe from complications regarding privacy or data. In this regard, the regulators take the responsibility for resolving legal matters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, data privacy is the first and foremost priority for any user. If they are not well-protected, then most likely we are dealing with scams. The license ensures that personal data is safe and secure with a website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The administration is doing its best to make the site a safe place for every user by creating different mechanisms to prevent fraudulent activities such as limiting the withdrawal process as well as checking email, which is a really positive thing for ThunderPick crypto sportsbook.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, you should always be careful when it comes to sharing your personal information with someone on the world wide web, as there are still many people on the Internet who want to take advantage of your financial opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall ThunderPick is a completely legit and safe casino. It has a license available which you can see at the bottom of the website.
