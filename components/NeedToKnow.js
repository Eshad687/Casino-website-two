            <span className='fs-5 '>While learning the intricacies of sports markets is very useful, it is only part of the overall equation.
                <br />
                <br />
                Winning in the long term is effectively impossible without knowing how wagering odds work.
                <br />
                <br />
                It doesn’t matter how much research you perform into sports markets; success will elude you if you take the wrong odds.
                <br />
                <br />
                When making bets, you have to realize that cryptocurrency betting sites have an edge on every market ranging from 3% to 30% or more.
                <br />
                <br />
                Your ultimate goal is to discover ‘mistakes’ in the odds occasionally made by betting websites.
            </span>

            <h2 className='mt-5 mb-3'>What is value Betting?</h2>
            <span className='fs-5'>
                Value wagering aims to discover a bookmaker error in a market.
                <br />
                <br />
                For instance, your research shows a 30% likelihood of Manchester United defeating Arsenal in the English Premier League.
                <br />
                <br />
                Suppose the odds of a United win are 2.50 on most cryptocurrency betting sites. Should you make a bet?
                <br />
                <br />
                No! 100/2.50 means the sports betting website believes there’s a 40% likelihood of a United win.
                <br />
                <br />
                When researching any event, your goal is to discover enough information to ascertain how likely an outcome is.
                <br />
                <br />
                At the end of this process, you’re rewarded with a ‘betting tissue,’ which helps you better understand a bookmaker’s odds.
                <br />
                <br />
                What’s a betting tissue? It is a method of creating your own odds.
                <br />
                <br />
                However, don’t even think about making one until you know more about the different types of sports betting odds.
                <br />
                <br />
                Many people don’t know how to calculate betting odds, so we’ve created a quick guide to the three most common types.


            </span>
            <h2 className='mt-5 mb-3'>American odds</h2>
            <span className='fs-5'>
                BTC sports betting websites that cater to users in the United States will often use American odds, which have a plus or minus sign before a number.
                <br />
                <br />
                Use the sign to determine if the potential profit in crypto is bigger or smaller than the size of your bet.
                <br />
                <br />
                If the sign is minus (-), it means odds of below evens, so your profit will be less than your bet if you win.
                <br />
                <br />
                A (+) sign means an odds-against wager, so your possible profit is higher than your original wager.
                <br />
                <br />

                Here are some examples of American odds and how much you could win depending on the size of your bet:
                <br />
                <br />
                <ul className="check-ul">
                    <li>
                        +110: wagering $100 and winning at these odds means a total return of $210
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        +150: By wagering at these odds, a win will yield a profit of $150
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        +300: Back any outcome at these odds with a $100 bet, and your total returns will be $400 if successful
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        -110: If you bet at this price, your overall profit with a win is $90.91
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        -150: bet $100 at these odds and win, and you benefit from a return of $166.67
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        -300: If you bet $100 and your selection is successful, you benefit from a return of $133.33
                    </li>
                </ul>


            </span>
            <h2 className='mt-5 mb-3'>Decimal odds</h2>
            <span className='fs-5'>
                If you live in Europe, you’re likely familiar with decimal odds which are the most basic form.
                <br />
                <br />
                To calculate your possible returns, multiply the size of your bet in crypto by the odds.
                <br />
                <br />
                For instance, if you wish to bet $200 on England to beat Sweden at odds of 1.6, you multiply 200 x 1.6, which equals 320.
                <br />
                <br />
                An English victory means you enjoy a $120 profit as 320 – 200 = 120.
                <br />
                <br />
                To discover the probability of any pick winning in percent, divide the odds into 100.
                <br />
                <br />
                Using the above example, England has a 62.5% chance of winning according to the BTC betting website, since 100/1.6 = 62.5.



            </span>
            <h2 className='mt-5 mb-3'>Fractional odds</h2>
            <span className='fs-5'>
                Generally speaking, fractional odds are popular in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
                <br />
                <br />
                This odds format features a slash between two numbers.
                <br />
                <br />
                For example, if you wager on an outcome at odds of 6/1, you receive $7 back for every $1 you risk.
                <br />
                <br />
                Therefore, if you wager $10 worth of crypto at odds of 6/1, you would win $70 if successful, for a profit of $60.
                <br />
                <br />
                The figure on the left-hand side is the profit you’ll earn if you wager the amount of money staked on the right-hand side.
                <br />
                <br />
                Let’s say you back the Tennessee Titans to defeat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at odds of 11/4; this means your profit is $11 for every $4 you bet should the Titans win.
                <br />
                <br />
                Of course, you have to include the crypto you staked to determine the full payout.
                <br />
                <br />
                Most Bitcoin betting websites will allow you to change the odds format, so experiment to see which one you like the most.
